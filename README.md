Professional Internship - Control of a stepper motor

This project aims to optimize the performance of an automated power screwdriver by controlling a NEMA-17 stepper motor using a PIC16F876A microcontroller programmed in mikroC. A LabVIEW interface was developed to monitor and adjust motor parameters in real-time.

Initially, the project was tested on a single stepper motor, but in the final implementation, it will be replicated on three axes (X, Y, Z) for full motion control.

Technologies and Tools used : 

  Microcontroller: PIC16F876A

  Firmware Programming: mikroC for PIC

  Control Interface: LabVIEW

  Simulation & Testing: Proteus

  Hardware: NEMA-17 stepper motor  

  Protocol Communication : UART

 Features
 
   Precise stepper motor speed & direction control
   
   Optimization of the power screwdriver's torque and efficiency
   
   Real-time motor parameter adjustments via LabVIEW
   
   Serial communication between PIC & LabVIEW (UART)
   
   Simulation & debugging using Proteus
   
   Scalability: Future deployment on three axes (X, Y, Z)
